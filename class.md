# Vector
Async. Similar to Arraylist. Only one thread can modify Vector a time

# Arraylist
Async. Similar to Vector. Multiple threads can modify Arraylist at the same time

# Volatile
Volatile controls memory visibility to multiple thread. With volatile, the value marked to be volatile changes (other threads in particular) after a write operation. Without volatile, other threads reade non-updated value. Volatile variables are typically used to break out of a loop.
