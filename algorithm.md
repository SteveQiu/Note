# Concept

memory in exchange of performance

consider using property with the most limited bound as memory cache/array id

if no obvious mathematic relation found, dp is needed.

# Performance Comparison

while loop < function return

variable < function return

switch < 2+ if else

assignment < comparison

# Sorting

insertion sort 1/2 n^2

merge sort 6n log2n + 6n

insertion sort = merge sort @ n ~= 90

Quicksort - highly  efficient  for  large  data  sets
 
Bubble sort - is  actually  more  efficient  for  small  data  sets

# Space and Storage

Hash Table : key and value match

data[]: Fix number of data(boolean int)

Int : 32 bits of boolean

# change on new milestone

Store milestone and relative distance

update milestone base on +/- distance
